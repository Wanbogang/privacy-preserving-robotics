## Release Notes

### Version 0.1.0 - Initial Public Release

This release establishes the foundational framework for privacy-preserving home
robotics. Key achievements:

**Technical Proof-of-Concept**: Three working demonstrations prove that robots
can maintain behavioral continuity and provide safety monitoring without
biometric identification or surveillance data storage.

**Complete Documentation**: Full paper, architecture docs, and use cases provide
comprehensive understanding of the framework's principles and implementation.

**Open Development**: GPL-3.0 license, contribution guidelines, and issue
templates establish foundation for community development.

**Next Steps**: Focus on unit testing, ROS2 integration, and expanding use case
demonstrations based on community feedback.
